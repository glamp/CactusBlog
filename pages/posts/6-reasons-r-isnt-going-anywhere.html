Recently there's been a flurry of blog posts and articles describing how Python
is taking over R and that Python and/or Julia are going to blow it out of the
water. But if you think that you're escaping from the death grip of `R`? I've
got news for your Mr. Scientist, `R` is here to stay (at least for a while).

I came across Matt Asay's [article](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/25/python-displacing-r-as-the-programming-language-for-data-science)
a few weeks ago on HackerNews. It's a great article, and I think the two
strongest arguments it makes are:

- R is a pain in tough to learn
- Python is general purpose, wheras R is a specialist's language

And while I think these things might be true, I don't think R is going to 
be displaced by Python in the near future.

### R is still cutting edge
So I'm not really sure how this one goes unnoticed, but despite the bitching 
about the syntax, R is still a cutting edge tool with millions of users.

### Time
R isn't new. It's been around for about 20-30 years. It's not just going to go
away overnight.

- There are thousands of packages on [CRAN](http://cran.rproject.org). You can
find niche, hyper-specific packages that fit your particular need.
- Large organizations using R aren't going to make "the switch" overnight. Many
companies are *just now* escaping the death grip that `SAS` (the programming 
langauge, not [SaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/software-as-a-service)). These are
the  entities that constitutue a large portion of the user base, despite not
having a very large voice. If and when these types of organizations move away 
from R, it's going to take time happen (on the order of multiple years).

### RStudio > IPython Notebook
The IPython Notebook is great for presentations and tutorials, but when it comes
to an actual analytical IDE, it's hard to beat [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org)
. It looks great, is fast, and is __the best__ web based app I have used. It
actually feels the same as using it on your local computer.

### How many people are *actaully* switching?
If you read [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) or
[/r/programming](http://reddit.com/r/programming), you're most likely being
over-exposed to tech that is "cool" but not neccessarily mainstream.

Just think about how many B and C level R programmers are out there. They're not
the sort of people who are considering moving to Python because there's a better
version of RandomForest. 

### Because Hadley Wickham will be
R's fearless leader. Mr. Wickham has built `plyr`, `stringr`, and most
notably, `ggplot2`. It's a laundry list of functionality that *should* exist in
base R, but doesn't.

I'm also excited about [Advanced R Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/). I
think it will help make package development in `R` more accessible to the 
typical R user. Previously, the best documentation for building `R` packages
was found [here](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html). Functional?
Yes. Thurough? You bet. Helpful? Maybe. Easy to follow? Absolutely not.

I have no doubt that the R community continue to benefit for Mr. Wickham's
generosity in the years to come.

### Pydata is confused
Pydata is the non-profit wing of Continuum Analytics. It essentially gives them
a seperate avenue for raising money via donations and grants by which they can 
pay developers to work on open source/government projects. In concept, I think
it's great! We get more open source tools! But to date I've been a little 
disappointed in the tools that have come out of the program:

- [`Bokeh`](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh) takes dependency hell to a 
different level. As I'm reading the dependencies list, it seems like 10 
engineers were put in a room and just starting listing technologies and concepts
that they thought were cool. In addition it's supposed to be an implementation
of the grammar of graphics as well, though it really just looks like
`matplotlib`.
- [`Numba`](http://numba.pydata.org/) Seriously, who uses this?
- [`Blaze`](http://blaze.pydata.org/) is entering shit or get off the pot
territory. It sounds sweet (next gen `numpy`) but I don't think it's going to be
relevant for a long time. `numpy` only got popular once we were given `pandas`. 
The fact of the matter is people like their data in rectangles--Excel, data 
frames in R and `pandas`. So in order for `Blaze` to be of use to the average
data scientist, `Blaze` is going to need a pandas-esque counterpart.


### Final Thoughts

- R is easy to install
- You can do __a lot__ in base R
- Most analysts don't want a gernal purpose language (or at least don't know
they *should* want one)
