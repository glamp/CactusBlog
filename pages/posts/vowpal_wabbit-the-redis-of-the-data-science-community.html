`vowpal_wabbit`, or `vw`, is an online learning program built by
[Yahoo! Research](http://). It's fairly basic to use, it's essentially a command
line tool and it's mostly written in C++. Even the [website](http://hunch.net/) 
is super simple.

Using `vw` basically maxes out your data science [cheaupaux](). It's like not 
wearing a mask in hockey, or having lift tickets from 3 foreign countries on 
your ski jacket. Yeah, it's that cool.

### So it's cool, but what is it?

`vw` was designed with the following in mind:

- one
- two
- three
- four


I've always thought of `vw` as being a "data scientist's data scientist's tool".
 It's one of those technologies where in order to get anything out of it you 
have to know what you're doing.

*You better know what you're getting into*


### Sort of like redis
It actually reminds me a lot of [`redis`](http://redis.io/). redis is one of
those tools that never fails to get engineers excited. My take on it is that
it's so simple yet powerful that it's sort of a test of an engineer's true
skill.

I see the exact same sort of reaction from data scientists when talking about
`vw`. *Finally! A chance to show off my math!*

### What's it look like?
Installing `vw` requires you to use `make`. It'll blast through a bunch of C++
and leave you with the `vw` command. Now there have been clients written in 
other programming languages like [`vowpal_porpoise`](link/here), but the 
traditionalist in me loves using `vw` in its purist form.

    $ vw --adaptive -p /dev/stdout
