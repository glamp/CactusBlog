Last monday I was talking to a co-worker about their weekend. He was in a particulary good mood because he had won 4-5 bets on college football. I asked him if he bet on the NFL as well to which he answered, "No, college is easy but the NFL is a crapshoot." He went on to say that even though margin of victory isn't important in the BCS standings, teams are pressured to cover the spread in order to do well in the AP and Coaches polls. I decided to flush out this hypothesis...

Step 1: Data collection...

There are plenty of sites that offer historical spreads for college football games. I wrote a quick screen scraper using Python that collected the team, spread, score, and date for each game and each team since 1985. It was pretty basic--just BeautifulSoup writing to a csv.

<insert code snippet>

Step 2: Loading it into R...

Next I wanted to take a look at the relationship between the Vegas spreads vs the acutal results of the games. As you might expect things looked pretty normal. I wound up limiting to games played since 2000 to make the sample a little more consistent.

Controlling for some other variables like week of the season and year didn't seem to make much difference.

Things start to get interesting when you bring school into the fold. When comparing between # of spreads covered vs. uncovered you seem some interesting trends.

When you start segmenting the data based on each team, things start to get a little bit more interesting. Looking at % of spreads covered for schools ranges from UCONN and Boise St at 61% to Washington at 37%. Interestingly enough, arch rivals Ohio State and Michigan wind up at opposite ends of the spectrum with Michigan near the bottom and Ohio State at #3. The least shocking to me was Boise State. With so many walkover games, Boise needs to cover the spread week in and week out in order to gain any semblance of respect from the rest of the country.

So why do some schools have a propensity to cover the spread more than others?
